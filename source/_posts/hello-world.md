## Welcome!

And as we often say:

``` python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This freshly-compiled blog is where I plan discussing interesting aspects of programming and related topics - from minor trivia that can trip or elevate our code (which we often gloss over) to abstract approaches to thinking about our life as developers.

Myself, I am a full-stack and multi-paradigm software engineer and hacker with a keen interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning and brain-computer interfaces (check the [about page](/about) for more info).

Our field is vast, ever-changing and deeply fascinating - so hop on and we shall venture forth together!
